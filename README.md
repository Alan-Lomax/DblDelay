# DblDelay

This class defines a timer that has individually configurable on delay and off delay intervals which are handled directly in the class. 
The code is written in a non-blocking manner -- no use of delay() -- so calling the update method in the loop code is required
and then checking the output to perform your required actions.

Two different delays are involved using a passed boolean value as a trigger.
- When the boolean goes from "low to high" the output of this class also goes from "Low to High" after an ON Delay period that you define.
- Conversely when the boolean goes from "high to low" the output of this class also goes from "high to low" but this time after an OFF Delay period that you also define.

On a model railway this type of timer is very handy for general timing, signalling and automation . 

Notes:
1) This class does not associate with any specific I/O pins it just wants a boolean 'input'
2) Either of the time intervals could be 'zero' thus making it a simple 'On Delay' only, or 'off delay only.
3) For a visual representation see this simple timing chart:

4) Some sensors (active IR sensors - varies by manufacturer) are inverted whereby the signal is normally high (when nothing is in the beam)
   and when something is detected the signal goes low.  For these types of sensors set the boolean "invertInput" parameter to true.

An example of use:
Using a Light dependant resistor (LDR) to detect a passing train. Send the on/off value to a timer of this class and it can activate signals
after a few seconds. The signals connected to the output will not change if a small gap passes over the LDR (It is inherantly 'debounced' because of the off delay.) 
Furthermore a long off delay would keep the signals at "danger" until the train has truly passed on down the line.
A second timer (using the same input but with different timing values) could trigger some trackside animation effects (like sounds).

### Example Program:
    /*
      DblDelay Example
      Objective: Turn on a Light Emitting Diode(LED) when a sensor detects an object.
      The output is subject to a 1 second 'on delay' and a 5 second "off delay" vs the input state.
      Note: some sensors are logic 'high' when nothing is detected and only go "low" when something is detected.
      Change the value of 'invertInput' from false to true or vice versa to compensate for this.
